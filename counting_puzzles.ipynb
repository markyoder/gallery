    "### The \"Adds up to 100\" puzzle:\n",
    "- The question is more or les stated, \"Given some vector of \"numbers\" $X$ of positive numbers, which might be quite large, how many pairs of numbers add up to 100?\"\n",
    "- First, answer the question with a question: What kind of numbers? Integers? Over what range -- are all of the numbers $x_j < 100$?\n",
    "- Here, we will provide reasonably general solutions for both the continuum and integer cases.\n",
    "- Note that fundamentally, this is an $ON^2$ problem, but we want to reduce that as much as possible.e \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary findings:\n",
    "- We can use sorting based strategies to significantly reduce the order of the algorithm for continuum sequences, though the performance of such an algorithm might be difficult to anticipate\n",
    "- For integers, we can reduce the problem to approximately $ON$, or $c \\to ON$ in the limit of very large $N$. This reduction arises from the simple fact that, no matter how large $N$ is, there are only 101 distinct values of interest, all positive integers $x \\le 100$, including $0$. Therefore, we can index the set like, $I = \\{ x:n_x, ... \\}$ where $0 \\le x \\le 100$ are the values of $x$ and $n_x$ are the number of that value in the set.\n",
    "- We can now look for the number of pairs in this reduced set, and in fact, because the valuse are integer type, we can again use our index. For each value $x_j$, we can compute its compliment, $x^c_j = 100 - x_j$; we can then look up $x^c_j$ in our index, and the"
