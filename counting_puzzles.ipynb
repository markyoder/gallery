    "- For integers, we can reduce the problem to approximately $ON$, or $c \\to ON$ in the limit of very large $N$. This reduction arises from the simple fact that, no matter how large $N$ is, there are only 101 distinct values of interest, all positive integers $x \\le 100$, including $0$. Therefore, we can index the set like, $I = \\{ x:n_x, ... \\}$ where $0 \\le x \\le 100$ are the values of $x$ and $n_x$ are the number of that value in the set.\n",
    "- We can now look for the number of pairs in this reduced set, and in fact, because the valuse are integer type, we can again use our index. For each value $x_j$, we can compute its compliment, $x^c_j = 100 - x_j$; we can then look up $x^c_j$ in our index, and the"

For example, in the spirit of the initial question, as stated, we might want all pairs $x_j,~x_j$ such that $99.0 < x_j + x_k < 100$.\n",
